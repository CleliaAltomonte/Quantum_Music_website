  <h1>Welcome to Quantum Music</h1>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">Explore quantum mechanics through music by mapping qubits to musical notes and quantum circuits to music scores. <br>
  Go to the Theory section for a gentle introduction into quantum mechanics and its analogy to music.  <br>
  In the Gallery section you will find some examples. The first three scores are very simple and meant to exemplify important quantum mechanical properties such as SUPERPOSITION and ENTANGLEMENT. <br>
  If you would like to experiment with the sound of quantum for yourself, go to
<a href="https://algassert.com/quirk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    Open Quirk Quantum Circuit Simulator
  </a> to create your own quantum circuit, or create it in any other way (using qiskit for example). Add barriers where you want the musical notes to be recorded. Then use this code <a href="https://github.com/CleliaAltomonte/Quantum_Music_code" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Music</a> to output your music.

    <p>After completing this project, we became aware of the attempts of others at exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and music. This project locates itself in this research stream, and we hope it will inspire others to explore it further.

  <h2>Theory</h2>
  <p>This section will include music theory explanations, scales, modes, and other concepts.</p>

    A BIT is the classical unit of information, it has a value that is either 0 or 1. <br>
    A QUBIT, is the quantum unit of information, and since it obeys the rules of QUANTUM MECHANICS, it can be in a SUPERPOSITION of states, 0 and 1 at the same time, each with a given probability amplitude. <br>
    It can also be ENTANGLED with other qubits, which means that their states are not independent, and correlated in such a way that it is often not possible classically.  </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      The state of a qubit can be visualized on the BLOCH SPHERE using 3D rotations as a basis. Each state is identified with two angles, &theta; and &phi;. <br>

      The effect of multiple quantum gates can be written as a QUANTUM CIRCUIT, that is read as (and resembles) a music sheet. Hence, we can use this analogy to gain insight into quantum mechanics.

    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      More than one mapping is possible, but we map the state of each qubit through the angles &theta; and &phi; to musical notes since it gives the most interesting results. <br>

      Then, we create a quantum circuit, that tells us what operations are applied to each qubit. <br>
      Our code reads the state of the qubits where barriers are located in the circuit, and translates that into a music score.

    </p>

    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      Some post processing (for example of the notes duration) and a good choice of mapping between angles and notes may make the music score even more interesting. <br>

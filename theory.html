  <h3>Gentle introduction to Quantum Information</h3>
  <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
    A BIT is the classical unit of information, it has a value that is either 0 or 1. <br>
    A QUBIT, is the quantum unit of information, and since it obeys the rules of QUANTUM MECHANICS, it can be in a SUPERPOSITION of states, 0 and 1 at the same time, each with a given probability amplitude. <br>
    It can also be ENTANGLED with other qubits, which means that their states are not independent, and correlated in such a way that it is often not possible classically.  </p>

    <h3>Mapping qubit state to sound</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      The state of a qubit can be visualized on the BLOCH SPHERE using 3D rotations as a basis. Each state is identified with two angles, &theta; and &phi;. To read the state of an individual qubit, we perform the PARTIAL TRACE over the other qubits. <br>

      The effect of multiple quantum gates can be written as a QUANTUM CIRCUIT, that is read as (and resembles) a music sheet. Hence, we can use this analogy to translate into sound some quantum mechanical properties.

    <h3>Different mappings</h3>
    <p style="line-height: 1.8;">

      We use the angles &theta; and &phi; to map the state of a qubit to sound, and map each qubit to a different instrument; More than one mapping through the angles &theta; and &phi; is possible, for example:</p>
      <ul style="line-height: 2;">
      <li>MAPPING 1: angles &theta; and &phi; are mapped to notes of different octaves. It is possible to refine the choice of notes by chosing a given scale, such as chromatic or pentatonic. All notes have the same duration.</li>
      <li>MAPPING 2: angles &theta; and &phi; are mapped to notes of different octaves. It is possible to refine the choice of notes by chosing a given scale, such as chromatic or pentatonic. Notes duration is also set by &theta;.</li>
      <li>MAPPING 3: angle  &phi; is mapped to notes of a given octave. It is possible to refine the choice of notes by chosing a given scale, such as chromatic or pentatonic. All notes have the same duration, but the volume is set by &theta;.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
      Some other choices are possible to make the score more interesting, for example introducing a small offset in the notes range of each subsequent qubit. <br>
      It is also possible to set some choices, such as notes duration, by postprocessing the score, but it is important to consider that, while this may make a score resemble more a music track, this may hide and make less evident some quantum mechanical properties such as entanglement.

      <h3>From quantum circuit to music score</h3>
      </p>
      Then, we create a quantum circuit, that tells us what operations are applied to each qubit. <br>
      It is possible to both translate known circuits (such as Grover's algorithm or the Quantum Fourier Transform) to sound, or writing a custom circuit. You can find some examples of each in the Gallery section. <br>
      Our code reads the state of the qubits where barriers are located in the circuit, and translates that into a music score.
